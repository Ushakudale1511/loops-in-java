Loops or iteration statements come under the umbrella of control structures in Java. The control statements, as the name suggest, control or direct the flow of execution in a program. 

Generally, there are 3 types of Control Structures in Java:

Conditional Statements or Decisional Statements (if, if-else, switch)

Iteration Statements (for, while, do-while, for-each)

Jump Statements (break, continue, return)

Letâ€™s understand Iteration Statements or loops in Java.

What are Loops in Java?
Imagine a scenario wherein your requirement is to execute a statement repeatedly. Say you have to print all the even numbers between 1-100. The result of this execution requires you to check again and again if the number is divisible by two or not. Then print those numbers accordingly. Individual calculation and execution of each line will take a tedious amount of time. It invokes the requirement of iteration statements or loops in Java Programming.

Iteration statement saves a lot of time and effort for the programmer.
